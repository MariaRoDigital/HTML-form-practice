<br>
This was my first challenge creating a form out of scratch and using a reset.css stylesheet. Below are the task challenges that Codecademy gave me to include in my form. Branding was included in the project as a fun
addition to the challenge, to see if I could achieve the vision I had in my mind.<br>
<br>

- [ ] Create a form with multiple fields that accept user input.
- [ ] Add two separate sets of radio buttons or checkboxes.
- [ ] Search how to add a placeholder (hint) to an input field. A placeholder shows up when the field has no value, it disappears after the user types or selects something in the field. <br>

Personal Challenge:<br><br>

- [ ] Add branding
- [ ] Get critique
